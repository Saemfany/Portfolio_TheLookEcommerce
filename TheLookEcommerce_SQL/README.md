# THELOOK ECOMMERCE DATA ANALYSIS WITH SQL

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the theLook eCommerce dataset using SQL queries. The objective was to answer specific business questions by extracting insights from the data. This document outlines the queries used, the logic behind them, and the conclusions drawn.

This project was carried out in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using [TheLook Ecommerce](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce) dataset available in the BigQuery data warehouse.
