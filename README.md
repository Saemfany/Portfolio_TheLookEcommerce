# theLook eCommerce Data Analysis

This data analysis project for **theLook eCommerce** was conducted using two methods:

1. **SQL**: The entire process, including data input, cleaning, processing, visualization, and drawing conclusions, was carried out using SQL. This approach focused on querying and manipulating the data directly from the database.

2. **Python**: Similarly, the full analysis pipeline, from data input to cleaning, processing, visualization, and generating insights, was performed using Python. This method leveraged Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

Both methods offer valuable insights and complement each other in understanding the dataset and deriving business conclusions.
