This notebook demonstrates how to analyze eCommerce data using Python. We are using the dataset provided by theLook eCommerce, which includes orders, products, and customer information. The analysis will focus on answering the following business questions:

- What is the total revenue received by theLook eCommerce?
- How many customers, orders, and lost order opportunities are in the dataset?
- What are the revenue trends by year?
- Which products, brands, and categories are top performers?
- Which countries are the top revenue-generating?

**Note:** The code structure and steps used in the analysis, data visualization, data insights, and conclusions are witten in [`theLook_eCommerce.ipynb`](https://github.com/Saemfany/Portfolio_TheLookEcommerce/blob/38932721adc2bf366bf5b487b2c5759b211e8135/theLook_eCommerce_Python/theLook_eCommerce.ipynb). The code structure is executed in Google Colab.
